# Project-355
: 2.05 MW Renewable Energy Project in Tamil Nadu

The project “2.05 MW Renewable Energy Project in Tamil Nadu” is located at GVG Paper Mills
Pvt. Ltd.(Unit-1), Village Nallur Pushpathur, Taluk Palani 624 618, District Dindigul, State Tamil
Nadu, Country India.

The project results in reductions of CO2 emissions that are real, measurable and give long-term
benefits to the mitigation of climate change. Emission reductions attributable to the project are
included in the UCR Positive List of Project Types deemed to be additional and also meet the “Do
No Net Harm to Society and Environment” criteria under the UCR CoU Standard.

Purpose of the project activity:
The purpose of the project activity, promoted by GVG Paper Mills Private Limited (Unit-1), is to
install 22 TPH biomass fired boiler with back pressure turbine to cater the electricity and steam
demand of the company. The captive co-generation plant of 2050 kW capacity is utilized for running
the operational unit. The plant is expected to supply about 410.06 TJ of process heat in terms of steam
and 16.728.45 GWh of electricity per annum.

The Project owner is one of the largest integrated paper manufacturers in India, and across Tamil
Nadu. The project activity was commissioned in 17/04/2019. The paper manufacturing demand both
steam and electricity. In absence of this project activity, equivalent amount of energy and steam would
have been sourced from more carbon intensive sources i.e. Coal. The project activity thus reduces
61,152 tCO2e/annum greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by avoiding fossil fuel combination for steam
and power generation.
